PIPENV install issue fixed:

First, remove your current version of virtualenv: pip uninstall virtualenv
Then, remove your current version of pipenv: pip uninstall pipenv
When you are asked Proceed (y/n)? just enter y. This will give you a clean slate.
Finally, you can once again install pipenv and its dependencies: pip install pipenv
Check installation with pipenv --version
